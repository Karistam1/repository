  abstract = {The Nordfjord-Sogn Detachment (NSD) zone of western Norway juxtaposes eclogites and gneisses of lower crustal affinity with sedimentary deposits, suggesting that the zone experienced substantial displacement during Devonian extensional denudation of the Caledonides. Renewed activation occurred in Permian and Jurassic-Cretaceous times. The detachment zone consists of a succession of fault-related rocks reflecting various crustal positions and deformation mechanisms during activation and unroofing. In more detail, the lower 1–2 km thick section of the NSD zone consists of mylonites with various protoliths, showing a general upward decrease in metamorphic grade. The mylonitic section is truncated by the NSD fault, defining the boundary toward hanging wall nappe rocks that are topped by sedimentary basins. In an attempt to provide precise descriptions of the observed fault rocks, we classify these rocks into (1) noncohesive breccias, (2) cemented and indurated breccias of secondary cohesion, and (3) cataclasites, phyllonites, and mylonites formed with primary cohesion. Along and across-strike sections of the fault reveal the spatial and temporal relationships of the NSD fault. The fault zone consists of a lower section of phyllonites and cataclasites, reaching a total thickness of 50–70 m. Significant volumes of pseudotachylyte were injected into these fault rocks, and were later reworked. Reactivation of the fault is suggested by overprinting carbonate-cemented breccias that are cut by a discrete fault itself associated with breccias and gouge. By comparing the various fault rocks and their formation mechanisms, some constraints can be applied to the unroofing history. The NSD fault developed in the ductile-brittle transition zone of the crust, where it experienced an initial shift from mainly frictional to plastic flow caused by reaction softening, before hardening caused a return to frictional flow. At the same time, repeated pulses of pseudotachylyte were generated, possibly lubricating the fault zone and contributing to strain localization. These pseudotachylyte pulses also show that the fault was affected by seismic slip events, before returning to a creep regime within a wider section than that ruptured by earthquakes. Younger cemented breccias and noncohesive breccias and gouge reflect earthquake-rupturing and frictional flow within the seismogenic crust.},

  abstract = {Lithospheric extension is sited, preferentially, along orogenic belts because they have a thicker continental crust, contain structural inhomogeneities, and suffer extensional orogenic collapse caused by body forces resulting from isostatically compensated elevation and sharp elevation gradients. Collapse occurs especially where rapid advective thinning of the shortened thermal boundary conduction layer occurs beneath an orogen and causes rapid uplift. Where boundary forces are compressional, extension is balanced by radial thrusting to form oroclinal loops around collapsed extensional basins. Where, as in the disruption of Pangea, boundary forces change rapidly from compressional to tensional, body force collapse is continued by general extension which may lead to continental splitting. Even where overall convergence is continuing, orogenic collapse may be enhanced by subduction rollback into small remnant oceans. The extensional collapse of orogens offers a partial explanation for why oceans cyclically close and reopen in roughly the same places, preservation of very high pressure metamorphic rocks, for the return of orogenic large crustal thicknesses to normal without very much erosional denudation with the widespread preservation of supracrustal sequences, high temperature metamorphic assemblages and the minimum‐melting granite suite.},

Identification and characterization of the diamond grains by Raman and infrared spectroscopy indicate the presence of substitutional impurities of H and N. Primary fluid inclusions in garnet and quartz in the diamond-bearing rock demonstrate the evolution of metamorphic volatile fluids from reduced N2-CO2 compositions during the peak phase of metamorphism, to N2-CH4 ± H2O–bearing compositions during retrograde metamorphism. Compatible geologic, petrologic, and fluid composition data imply a metamorphic origin for the microdiamonds; if so, the metamorphic and fluid conditions recorded by the microdiamonds and gneissic host may be applicable to microdiamond investigations in other high-pressure, regionally metamorphosed orogens.}

The extensional deformation is not restricted to the internal parts of the orogen, but can be traced for more than 200 km from the west coast of Norway toward the foreland. It involved significant reactivation of the basal thrust zone as a low-angle extensional detachment, whic consequently contains abundant top-to-the-(north)west sense of shear indicators. The extensional deformation involved substantial backsliding of the orogenic wedge (eduction of the Baltic shield) together with stretching of the basement by west-dipping, extensional shear zones. After ∼30 km of backsliding, the extensional detachment splayed to penetrate the overlying orogenic edifice in the coastal region in southern Norway, which led to inactivation of the main portion of the basal thrust zone as an extensional detachment.}

  abstract = {Smøla island, situated within the mid-Norwegian passive margin, contains crystalline-basement-hosted intricate fracture and fault arrays formed during a polyphase brittle tectonic evolution. Its detailed study may strengthen correlation attempts between the well-exposed onshore domain and the inaccessible offshore domain, further the understanding of the passive margin evolution, and provide useful constraints on petrophysical properties of fractured basement blocks. A combination of geophysical and remote sensing lineament analysis, field mapping, high-resolution drill hole logging, 3D modelling, petrographic and microstructural studies, and fault gouge K–Ar geochronology made it possible to define five deformation episodes (D1 to D5). These episodes occurred between the post-Caledonian evolution of the regional-scale Møre–Trøndelag Fault Complex (MTFC) and the Late Cretaceous and younger crustal extension preceding the final stages of Greenland–Norway break-up. Each reconstructed deformation stage is associated with different structural features, fault and fracture geometries, and kinematic patterns. Synkinematic mineralisations evolved progressively from epidote–prehnite, sericite–chlorite–calcite, chlorite–hematite, hematite–zeolite–calcite, to quartz–calcite. K–Ar geochronology constrains brittle deformation to discrete localisation events spanning from the Carboniferous to the Late Cretaceous. Multiscalar geometrical modelling at scales of 100, 10, and 1 m helps constrain the extent and size of the deformation zones of each deformation episode, with D2 structures exhibiting the greatest strike continuity and D1 features the most localised. Overall, the approach highlighted here is of great utility for unravelling complex brittle tectonic histories within basement volumes. It is also a prerequisite to constrain the dynamic evolution of the petrophysical properties of basement blocks.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Previously hypothesized fault weakening mechanisms include faults lined by low-friction clay gouges, elevated pore pressures within fault cores and/or the operation of dynamic weakening during seismic slip. Geological studies to support dynamic weakening are still in their infancy and there is little geological evidence for the widespread occurrence of low-friction gouges. The cores of some ancient faults exhumed from {$<$}5 km depth contain sheared syntectonic mineral veins. This observation is consistent with elevated pore pressures, but the implications for long-term fault weakening are unclear. Experimental data and microphysical modelling suggest that frictional–viscous flow within phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks (phyllonites, some foliated cataclasites) can cause sufficient weakening of crustal faults to satisfy published heat flow constraints. These predictions are consistent with the common occurrence of phyllonite in the cores of large-displacement faults exhumed from {$>$}5 km depth. Comparison with seismological data suggests that some faults with phyllonitic cores are likely to generate large earthquakes. Future studies should establish the geological evidence for seismic slip within phyllonitic fault cores and quantify the partitioning between seismic slip and frictional–viscous flow. Further geological observations are also required to test the hypothesized mechanisms by which earthquakes can nucleate and propagate along phyllosilicate-rich faults.},

  abstract = {Devonbassengene i Vest-Norge ble dannet i forbindelse med storskala normalforkastning i ekstensjonale detachment-soner. Disse bassengene var utsatt for syn-sedimentær ekstensjonsparallell folding, i tillegg til ekstensjonsrotering av de sedimentære lagene. Hornelen-bassenget består hovedsakelig av fluviale og lakustrine sandsteiner, og vifte-konglomerater langs bassengmarginene, som til sammen utgjør de tre «lithofacies-assosiasjonene». Den lavvinklede detachment-forkastningssonen som skiller de devonske sedimentene fra de kaledonske skyvedekkene og de proterozoiske grunnfjellsbergartene eksponerer forkastningsbergarter som representerer ulike deformasjonsstadier.  Denne masteroppgaven fokuserer hovedsakelig på de tektoniske kontaktene innad i bassenget i den nordlige delen, i tillegg til utviklingen av forkastningssone-produktene. Feltarbeid, optisk mikroskopering og «remote sensing» la grunnlaget som denne oppgaven er basert på.  Ved Svartevatnet, en rotert normalforkastning som sidestiller vifte-konglomerater i liggblokken med en blanding av de tre «lithofacies assosiasjonene» i hengblokken. Den anslåtte innsynkningen av sub-bassenget i hengblokken resulterte i et sedimentasjonsmiljø kontrollert av Svartevatnet-forkastningen. Innsjø-forflytning, elveløp-defleksjon og re-sedimentasjon via den opphøyde liggblokken er sannsynlige konsekvenser.  Kvantitativ rotasjon av forkastningsplanet og forkastningslineasjonene indikerer en nesten ekstensjons-vinkelrett, brattfallende, skrå «dip-slip» forkastning da den var aktiv. Den er anslått å være syn-sedimentær.  Syn-sedimentære forkastnings-relatert folding i form av, normale «drag-folder» og halvgraben «rollover-folder» var observert rundt forkastningsplanet. Basseng-skala lagningsrotasjon ble observert rett ved forkastningen, noe som tilsier at Svartevatnet-forkastningen spilte en viktig rolle under utviklingen av Hornelen-bassenget.  Detachment-forkastningssonen som slår gjennom Marøyna, ei øy rett vest for den nordlige delen av fastlandet, og forkastningsbergarter er derfor godt eksponert langs kystlinjen. Hvilke bergarter som kutter hverandre, samt klastinnholdet til bergartene dokumenterer en gradvis ekshumering fra den duktile delen av jordskorpa, gjennom den duktil-sprø-overgangssonen, og inn i den sprø delen av skorpa.  Betydelig laterale variasjoner på regional-, blotning- og mikroskala indikerer ekstrem tøyningslokalisering lang detachment-sonen. Faktorer som mineralogi, kornstørrelsesreduksjonsprosesser og fluidinjiseringer var sannsynligvis viktige bidragsytere til denne tøyningslokaliseringen.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For basins that evolve adjacent to large‐magnitude normal faults, tectonic controls on sedimentation involve isostatic back rotation of an exhuming footwall and, commonly, the evolution of kilometre‐scale extension‐parallel folds. Based on observations from classic localities in western Norway, we propose a three‐stage evolution scenario for transtensional supradetachment basins where the basins become progressively re‐arranged because of core complex exhumation and subsequent orthogonal shortening. Extension‐parallel transverse synclines initially form due to a normal displacement gradient, but when displacements accumulate beyond a certain magnitude, the hanging wall increasingly responds to core complex exhumation and the original depocentre, formed close to the original area of maximum displacement, will become inverted and dismembered above the core complex. Two new synclinal depocentres will develop along the flanks. Because these synclines form by extensional fault growth rather than by shortening, they will be associated with widening of the basin and onlap onto basement at high angles to the maximum elongation trend with overall grain‐size decrease and retrogradational stacking patterns. Further, because these synclines grow away from the evolving core complex, sedimentary units will become asymmetrically distributed inside each syncline in such a way that the oldest deposits in the syncline will be preserved on the flank most proximal to the core complex. In transtensional environments, a third evolutionary stage may involve constrictional strain where extension‐parallel folds and reverse faults produced by orthogonal shortening enhance or interact with other structures. Ultimately, initial extensional sub‐basins may become warped across extension‐parallel folds. Hanging wall deformation will be manifested in shifting accommodation patterns, with depocentres that generally migrate in the direction of the detachment fault. Accommodation patterns initially related to megafault growth may conceptually evolve into depocentres controlled by orthogonal shortening.},

  abstract = {From the Palacozoic to the Cretaceous, crustal thinning in the Mid Norway area was associated with the denudation of gneiss-cored culminations and metamorphic core complexes in the footwalls of major extensional faults. The development of the culminations led to warping and deactivation of early detachments, to the nucleation of new faults in more distal positions and to the exhumation of highgrade metamorphic rocks to more shallow levels in the crust. Some of the culminations and core complexes became part of the erosional template in Mid-Late Palaeozoic time, some were probably exhumed in the Mesozoic, whereas some may never have reached the surface. We present an overview of five types of gneiss-cored culminations and core complexes that have been identified in the field, through the interpretation of offshore, long-offset seismic reflection data. We furthermore address their mechanism(s) of formation, and their role in the progressive evolution of the Mid-Norwegian margin.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Structures related to orogenic “collapse” may provide an important template for reactivation during later rifting. In the proximal rifted margin offshore Norway, the tectono‐sedimentary template related to collapse of the Caledonian mountain belt became widely eroded but inherited metamorphic core complexes and detachment faults evolved further in Late Paleozoic and Earliest Mesozoic time and became associated with very significant crustal thinning. The earliest rifting mode was dominated by structures that mimic the Devonian post‐Caledonian template and comprised a suite of Late Paleozoic to Early Triassic metamorphic core complexes, detachment faults, and supradetachment basins. The deep structure indicates necking of brittle over remnant ductile crust, and we document how the main decoupling level utilized by the earliest rifting structures were cut by a suite of steeper, more deeply incising set of seaward‐ and landward‐dipping Triassic faults. The latter exploited deep shear zones related to the previous intracrustal necking, enabling changes in polarity over short distances. The change from a core complex mode of extension to one involving more deeply incising faults took place prior to deposition of the Late Triassic‐Early Jurassic interrift succession and pre‐dated the main phase of lithospheric‐scale necking associated with Jurassic‐Cretaceous extension. The latter phase of large‐magnitude faulting commenced with reactivation of seaward‐dipping, deeply incised faults inherited from early rifting as well as structures related to the phase of Devonian post‐orogenic transtension. The current study demonstrates that great structural complexity and significant magnitudes of extension may be present in proximal margins, in particular those developed along collapsed orogens.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The extensional “collapse” of orogens leaves behind a structural template which becomes reused and developed further in subsequent stages of rifting. Offshore Mid‐Norway, it was the earliest phase of rifting that became most profoundly affected by this inherited structural template. A system of detachment zones and faults, similar in style but younger in age than the orogenic collapse structures, became responsible for very significant crustal thinning in what was to become the margin's proximal domain. A suite of Late Paleozoic into Early Triassic basins became associated with this stage of deformation. This early configuration became cut by more deeply rooted normal faults in the Early Triassic, prior to thermal relaxation and deposition of a Late Triassic and Early Jurassic “interrift sequence.” In Late Jurassic times, a suite of seaward‐dipping large magnitude faults reactivated the more steeply dipping Triassic faults, heralding what was to become a necking of the entire crust. The significance of these observations lies in the documentation of the complex structural evolution and very significant crustal thinning that may accompany formation of the proximal parts of margins that develop on collapsed orogens.           ,              Key Points                                                                At rifted margins that evolve on collapsed orogens, inherited structures may be profoundly reactivated during early rifting                                                     The proximal domains of some rifted margins may be characterized by very significant amounts of crustal thinning                                                     The evolution of proximal margins may be complex involving detachment faults, core complexes, and incising steeper faults},

  abstract = {The Devonian rocks considered here, outcrop over a distance of 100 kms., along the northern side of a strip of water, known as the Trondheimsled, near Trondheim, Norway. Since time did not permit complete examination, two areas were selected for detailed study: 1) the western end of the outcrop on the large island of Hitra, where fossils suggesting an Upper Silurian or Downtonian age had been found; and 2) the outcrops on the island complex south of the neighbouring island of Smola. The precise age of these beds was unknown. An attempt was made to establish the stratigraphy of both areas, and to deduce the environment of deposition, the nature of the source area, and the direction of derivation of the sediments. Hitra. The succession (1055 m. thick) has been divided into a number of stratigraphical units on the basis of lithology. Much of it is made up of thick sandstones, often pebbly or conglomeratic, and alternating sandstone/siltstone sequences. Study of the sedimentary structures and size distributions of these sequences suggests that the cycles have been produced in an inshore estuarine environment, as a result of the lateral migration of channels. The petrography of the sandstones and conglomerates shown thot the sediments were derived from a source area composed mainly of plutonic rocks, while current direction analysis shows derivation from the northwest. Smola: The Smola Series, composed of 3745 m. of conglomerate, has been divided petrographically into four units. The oldest conglomerate lies unconformably on the beds below and is made up of large boulders of locally derived material. The younger conglomerates are composed of abundant pebbles of green sandstone (possibly the Ordovician Hovin Sandstone), and various igneous and metamorphic PEBBLES which are difficult to match with rocks now exposed in Norway. The sediments wore derived from the north and were probably deposited in a piedmont environment. Relative age of the Hitra and Smola series Consideration of the stratigraphical, petrographical, and sedimentological evidence shows that the Hitra sediments are older than those Smola. A reconsideration of the paleontological evidence suggests that the Hitra beds could be of Upper Welockian or early Ludlovian age, while the Smola beds are probably Lower or Middle Devonian.},

The main kinds of structures described involve sets of repeated secondary fractures (striated or not) which intersect the slip plane in a direction roughly perpendicular to the slip direction. Some of the most frequent criteria are new; their reliability is established in the field and by comparison with both previous and new experiments. It is shown that some of the rarer structures probably correspond to neo-rupture in intact rock, most probably at the tip of pre-existing joints, while the most frequent structures are generated by friction on joints, with very little sliding. The possible seismic origin of some structures is discussed.},

Onshore, it transects Devonian sedimentary rocks and a series of east to SE transported metamorphic nappes, which were emplaced during the Scandian (Silurian–Devonian) Orogeny. Offshore, the MTFC defines the southern margin of the Møre Basin and the northern margin of the Viking Graben, meaning that the fault complex played a major role in controlling the architecture of these Mesozoic basins. Onshore, the MTFC has had a prolonged and heterogeneous kinematic history. The complex comprises two major fault strands: the Hitra–Snåsa Fault (HSF) and the Verran Fault (VF). These two faults seem to have broadly initiated as part of a single system of sinistral ductile shear zones during the early Devonian (c. 410\>Ma). Sinistral transtensional reactivation (Permo-Carboniferous; 290\>Ma) of the ENE–WSW-trending HSF and VF led to the development of cataclasites and pseudotachylites together with the formation of north–south-trending faults establishing the present-day brittle fault geometry of the MTFC. Later phases of Mesozoic reactivation focused along the Verran Fault Zone (VFZ) and north–south-linking structures were probably related to mid- to late Jurassic to early Cretaceous rifting and late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic opening of the North Atlantic.Supplementary material: Supplementary datasets are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6390518Thematic collection: This article is part of the Caledonian Wilson cycle collection available at: https://www.lyellcollection.org/topic/collections/the-caledonian-wilson-cycle}
